Volunteers Application Documentation

I created The Volunteers Application which is a web-based platform specifically developed for charitable organisations to effectively administer volunteer events and activities. I used 3 web pages in my volunteers app, It enables users to manage volunteer sign-ups and create, modify, and delete volunteer events, as well as monitor event details including date, time, location, and available seats.
The project will fail because nodu_modules was removed from the root folder, which is essential to avoid uploading the nodu_modules folder to the intranet. However, in order to run the code, you must first install this folder by typing (npm intstall) into a new terminal.
The application can then be executed by typing (node server.js) into the terminal to execute the code. The following dependencies were utilised in my project: express, express-validator, and pug.
